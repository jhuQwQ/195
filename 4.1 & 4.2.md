# 4.1 & 4.2 

## 4.1 

### Structure of Proof

Start by assuming the hypothesis is true. Then, using only axioms, proven theories, use logical argument to show that the conclusion must be true.

### Assumptions/ Axions that can be used

#### Basic algebra laws 

commutativity, associativity and distribution

#### Transitivity of Equality

If A = B and B = C, then A = C

#### Closure of integers under addition, subtraction and multipication

#### There are no integers strictly between 0 and 1 

### Number Theory - THe study of whole numbers(integer)

Defns: 

We say n is even whenever $\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}\quad\text{s.t.}\quad n = 2k$ 

We say n is odd whenever $\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}\quad\text{s.t.}\quad n = 2k+1$ 

Defn:

An integer  n is prime if  $n>1$ and, for all positive integers r, s, if $n = rs$, then $r=n$ or $s=n$ 

Defn:

An integer is composite....if it is not primeðŸ˜±
